    "# Ensemble methods\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are interpretable and simple to implement models, but a single decision tree often suffers from high variance and thus struggle to generalize to new data. Ensemble methods refer to a group of strategies which mitigate this issue by **producing many different decision trees and determining classification using a consensus.** The idea is by basing our decisions off of the random variations of many suboptimal decision models, we arrive at a much stronger overall model. We discuss a few common ensemble methods in this notebook and how to implement them. \n",

    "## Common ensemble algorithms\n",
    "Some common ensemble strategies include: \n",
    "- Bagging \n",
    "- Random Forest (extension of bagging) \n",
    "- Extremely Randomized Trees \n",
    "- Boosting algorithms (not covered in this notebook) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Bagging \n",
    "Bagging refers to a method where multiple decision trees are created, **each from a random subset of the data.** Each subset is a random sampling of datapoints from the original dataset allowing for replacement, meaning the same sample can be chosen more than once. The subset is called a *bootstrapped dataset.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is a great way to reduce model variance because it *prevents any one decision tree from having full view of the entire dataset.* Consequently, the probability of overfitting the data is far less. Instead, bagging encourages smaller submodels (each deicion tree) to learn independent relationships within the data, which when combined, can better generalize a model for the data. \n",

    "## Boosting \n",
    "Boosting is a technique which involves producing multiple decision trees in a sequential manner. Each decison tree is created on the basis of reducing the error of the prior tree. Some common boosting algorithms include AdaBoost, Gradient Boost and XGBoost.\n"
